# LearningRuby
rewriting Zip Code Wilmington assessments in Ruby and then completing those assessments in Ruby 

In the effort of expanding my knowledge of OOP languages I'm attempting to learn Ruby. After skimming through a few tutorrials a la Google, as well as reading the Poignant Guide to Ruby over the past day and a half, I decided that in order to test myself is by ...testing myself. 

I've gone back through Zip Code Wilmington's cohort 4.1's assessments (which are still accessible for just these purposes) and decided to not only retake the assesments, but rewrite them in Ruby ..THEN retake the assesement ...ALSO IN RUBYYY!!

Insane ..I know ..but it's going to help quickly throw me into Ruby and enundate myself in the syntax. It will also sharpen my TDD skills.
